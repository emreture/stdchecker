Two methods are described. The first is intended for use by those with access to detailed information on loss density distribution within the transformer windings. The second is less accurate and is intended for use by those with access to transformer certified test report data only. It is anticipated that the first method will be used primarily by transformer design engineers, while the second will be employed primarily by users.

MAC Address Tag: Power-and-energy Home Tag: power-and-energy IEEE 1685-2009 Conformance checks for extensible Markup Language (XML) data designed to describe electronic systems are formulated by this standard. The meta-data forms that are standardized include: components, systems, bus interfaces and connections, abstractions of those buses, and details of the components including address maps, register and field descriptions, and file set descriptions for use in automating design, verification, documentation, and use flows for electronic systems. A set of XML schemas of the form described by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C\u00ae) and a set of semantic consistency rules (SCRs) are included. A generator interface that is portable across tool environments is\u2026 Read more IEEE C57.13.1-2006 This guide describes field test methods that assure that current transformers are connected properly, are of marked ratio and polarity, and are in a condition to perform as designed both initially and after having been in service for a period of time. Read more IEEE C37.016-2006 This Standard is applicable to AC circuit switchers designed for outdoor installation and for rated power frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz and rated maximum voltages of 15.5 kV through 245 kV. It is only applicable to three-pole circuit switchers for use in three-phase systems. This Standard is also applicable to the operating devices of circuit switchers and to their auxiliary equipment. Read more IEEE 1610-2007 This document specifies an exchange format, using XML, for identifying all of the hardware, software, and documentation associated with a unit under test (UUT). This UUT may be tested and diagnosed using a test program set (TPS) on an automatic test system (ATS). Read more IEEE C57.12.20-2011 Certain electrical, dimensional, and mechanical characteristics and safety features of single- and three-phase, 60 Hz, mineral-oil-immersed, self-cooled, overhead-type distribution transformers 500 kVA and smaller, high voltages 34 500 V and below, and low voltages 7970/13 800Y V and below are covered in this standard. Read more IEEE C57.104-2008 Detailed procedures for analyzing gas from gas spaces or gas-collecting devices as well as gas dissolved in oil are described. The procedures cover: 1) the calibration and use of field instruments for detecting and estimating the amount of combustible gases present in gas blankets above oil, or in gas detector relays; 2) the use of fixed instruments for detecting and determining the quantity of combustible gases present in gas-blanketed equipment; 3) obtaining samples of gas and oil from the transformer for laboratory analysis; 4) laboratory methods for analyzing the gas blanket and the gases extracted from the oil; and 5)\u2026 Read more IEEE 1415-2006 This guide provides maintenance testing and failure analysis guidance for form-wound, squirrel cage, induction machinery rated up to 15 kV. It addresses the following machine systems: Stator (Winding and Core) Rotor (Winding and Core) Vibration and Noise Bearings and Shafts Structure, Frame Ventilation Accessories. This guide is intended for use by personnel at the facility or corporate office responsible for the operation and maintenance of large induction machines. It is a guide to aid the thought processes and procedures necessary to determine root causes for failures.
